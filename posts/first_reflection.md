# First Reflection
### Digital Citizenship Presentation:

- Topic(s): Digital Citizenship, specifically Internet Safety
- What I struggled with: Making my part of the presentation short but detailed
- What I’m proud of: Having good examples to explain new terms such as "Apparent Character Substitutes"
- Next steps: Work on making my presentations shorter but with a similar amount of detail
